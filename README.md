openscad-gripclip
=================
A project to create a parametric shade grip clip suitable for 3d printing.

A grip clip can be used to join two sheets of material, or attach a rope to a sheet of material. We're intending to use these to secure multiple sheets of shade cloth together for our Burning Man camp.

NOTE: UNTESTED
==============
Still very experimental and untested, will update once I know more...
